# Introduction

Ariane algorithm is a particular case of algorithm where you need to lead a moving objet (![Thésée](https://ramsamy-ws.ovh/assets/img/realisations/ariane/thesee.png)) to a goal (![chest](https://ramsamy-ws.ovh/assets/img/realisations/ariane/coffre.png)) where there are obstacles (![wall](https://ramsamy-ws.ovh/assets/img/realisations/ariane/plot.png)).

This is inspired from the grec mythology where Thésée who is looking for the Minotaur, to kill him and put a end to the sacrifices lose his way in a maze and try to look for the exit.

This program help Thésée to find the exit but do not include the Minotaur.

# Global presentation

You can create maze from an empty grid or from a randomly generated grid, or load an existing maze.

You can either make a determinist search (look for the exit with the least of moves) or make a random search.

Then, you can watch the execution of the algorithme step by step (manuel) or directly get the number of moves (automatic).

# Technical presentation

This program have been made in JAVA 8 using awt and swing.

This program have been made in sublime text 3 and then re-made entirely in Intellij IDEA 2019 (CE)

This program is compiled with a MakeFile with make and by using make run to start the program.
